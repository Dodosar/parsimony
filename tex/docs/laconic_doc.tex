This document is intended for users who wish to learn how to program in Laconic. For users who want to know how to interpret or compile a Laconic program, information on how to do that is available in the \texttt{laconic_readme.pdf} file. The video tutorial at the root of this directory also explains how to run or compile Laconic files.
